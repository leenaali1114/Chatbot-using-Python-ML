# Chatbot-using-Python-ML

If you are interested in developing a chatbot, you may find that there are many powerful bot development frameworks, tools, and platforms that can be used to implement smart chatbot programs. In this project, let's walk through how to create a Chatbot with Python and Machine Learning.

#### How Does a Chatbot Work?
Since we will be developing a Chatbot with Python using Machine Learning, we need some data to train our model. But we’re not going to collect or download a large dataset since this is just a chatbot. We can just create our own dataset to train the model.

To create this dataset to create a chatbot with Python, we need to understand what intents we are going to train. An “intention” is the user’s intention to interact with a chatbot or the intention behind every message the chatbot receives from a particular user.

Therefore, it is important to understand the good intentions of your chatbot depending on the domain you will be working with. So why does he need to define these intentions? This is a very important point to understand.

In order to answer questions asked by the users and perform various other tasks to continue conversations with the users, the chatbot really needs to understand what users are saying or having ‘intention to do. This is why your chatbot must understand the intentions behind users’ messages.

How can you get your chatbot to understand the intentions so that users feel like they know what they want and provide accurate answers? The strategy here is to set different intents and create training samples for those intents and train your chatbot model with these sample training data as model training data (X) and intents in as model training categories (Y).

#### Create a Chatbot with Python and Machine Learning
To create a chatbot with Python and Machine Learning, you need to install some packages. All the packages you need to install to create a chatbot with Machine Learning using the Python programming language are mentioned below:

tensorflow==2.3.1
nltk==3.5
colorama==0.4.3
numpy==1.18.5
scikit_learn==0.23.2
Flask==1.1.2
